the command line arguments are either files or directories
====> two lists:   files list and directories list.
the files list is sorted and displayed seperately


for every entry int the list of entries :
    + 



==> long listing format:
    + If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future, 
    then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.
    + If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n option is given, 
    the numeric ID's are displayed.
    + If the file is a character special or block special file, 
    the major and minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field.
    + If the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by ``->''.





//TODO:
    function that reads the content of a directory and returns a list containing all the entries inside it.



Recursive listing: 


	+ Once we found a directory we display it name followed by ':' then its content;
	+ 

Phase 1: Stocking all cli arguments and sorting them in ASCII order unless -f is specified


Phase 2: Verifying arguments existence

    + stat all entries
        if an error occured report it and deallocate the entry
        else check the type of the entry
            if it is a file add it to ls->files
            else add it to ls->dirs

Phase 3: Sort files and directories lists independantly

    3.1 Process files first:
        + lookup ls->all and ls->files for list of files
        + check sort type:
            if ASCII sort: do not sort (because they are already sorted)
            else sort according to the given sort flag (-t{-u, -c}, -s)
        + Display files according to format flags (-l[-u, -c], -C, -1)

    3.2 Process dirs:
        + for each directory in ls->dirs:
            if it's a direcotry (since recursive call returns a mixed list):
                + open the directory and  get its content
                + sort the list of content if sort is specified
                + display the content according to format flag (-l[-u, -c], -C, -1)
                if the recursive flag is active:
                    + call ls_dirs with content as parameter
            else do nothing

Phase 4: Handle all display formats 

    + long format (-l):
        if the entries list belongs to a directory listing:
            display total blocks in one single line
        for each entry in list:
            display the file type
            display permissions        //TODO
